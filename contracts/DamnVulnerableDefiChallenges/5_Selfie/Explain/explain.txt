DAMN Vulnerable DEFI: 5-Selfie

We have 3 contracts: SimpleGovernance, iSimpleGovernance, SelfiePool.

ISimpleGovernance is the interface for the SimpleGovernance.
SelfiePool is where we can get a flashloan of DVT Tokens.

Problem in this contracts is:

For governance and pool we have the same token.

That means we can get a flashloan from the pool, manipulate the SimpleGovernance(DAO) and drain funds of the pool.

Steps to Follow:

1) Deploy all the contracts
2) Fill the pool with 1.5 MLN DVT Tokens
3) Hacker now:
    3.1) From SelfieAttack Contract, call the flashloan
    3.2) Once got the flashloan, hacker have enough DVT funds to create an action in the governance via
         queueAction() function.
         This action creates from the hacker will call the emergencyExit() function in selfiePool contract.
    3.3) Get the ID of the action.
    3.4) Wait 2 days
    3.5) Execute the action and drain the pool
